# Integration Readiness & Handover Notes

## 1. Stakeholder Integration Points
*   **Sankalp (Intelligence Layer):** Alignment on reasoning contracts. Ensure input/output formats are strictly adhered to.
*   **Raj Prajapati (Enforcement Engine):** Handing over the "Verboten Patterns" and Invariant list for integration into the gateway.
*   **Ishan Shirode (Task Systems):** Defining the "Audit Structure" compatibility for task completion signals.
*   **Abhishek Nishad (Evaluator Layer):** Decision semantics alignment—specifically how "Refusal" is scored.

## 2. Handover Checkpoints
- [x] Phase-0 Discovery Document Complete
- [x] Failure Taxonomy Defined
- [x] Boundary Invariants Formally Specified
- [x] Mock Harness Operational

## 3. Post-Phase-0 Action Items (Immediate)
1.  **Repo Access:** Ingest production code for `uni-guru.in`.
2.  **Telemetry Hook-up:** Connect the reasoning harness to the Bucket audit system.
3.  **Stress Test:** Execute the adversarial test suite against the live (unguardened) repo to baseline failure rates.
